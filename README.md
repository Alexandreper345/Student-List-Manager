# Student-List-Manager
This project is a simple login application for managing a student list. The application prompts for a username and password, where the correct credentials are:

# Username: abelha
# Password: abelinha

Once logged in, users can view the list of students, add new students, remove existing students, or choose a random student from the list. The application stores the student names in a text file for persistent data management.**
